# Getting Started

**as_built** analyzes your codebase and generates two AI-optimized documents: a technical reference for AI coding assistants and a human-readable overview for stakeholders.

## Running Your First Scan

1. Sign in and click **New Scan**.
2. Choose your input method — zip, folder, or GitHub repo.
3. Select an LLM provider and optionally enable the premium tier.
4. Click **Scan** and watch the live log.
5. Download your documentation when the scan completes.

Scans typically complete in 30–120 seconds depending on codebase size and provider. Larger codebases benefit from Gemini's wider context window.
