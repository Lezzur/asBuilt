# Understanding Outputs

## PROJECT_MANIFEST (AI-optimized)

A dense, technically precise document for AI coding assistants following the baryapps standard manifest format. Contains file paths, function signatures, data shapes, config keys, env vars, and component relationships. Feed this to Claude Code, Cursor, or any AI assistant before starting work on a project.

## AS_BUILT_HUMAN.md / .pdf (Human-readable)

A plain-language overview any stakeholder can understand. The PDF version includes a table of contents and page numbers. Share with product managers, clients, or new team members.

## PRD_DRIFT.md (Optional)

Generated when you attach a PRD to a scan. Documents what was fully implemented, what was changed, what's missing, and what was added beyond the original plan. Helps teams understand how reality diverged from the spec.
