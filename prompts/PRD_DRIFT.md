## Output Format: PRD_DRIFT.md

Compare the attached PRD against your analysis of the actual codebase. This is a forensic comparison — you are documenting where reality diverges from the plan.

### Mandatory Document Structure

### Section Requirements

**Summary** — 3-5 sentences capturing the headline story. What percentage of the PRD is implemented? What is the biggest area of drift? Is the project ahead of or behind the spec?

**Fully Implemented** — Table format:
| PRD Section | Feature | Evidence (file/module) |
Keep descriptions brief. The point is to confirm alignment, not re-describe the feature.

**Partially Implemented / Modified** — For each deviation:
- **PRD said:** Direct quote or paraphrase with section reference.
- **Code does:** What was actually built, with file references.
- **Nature of change:** Simplified | Expanded | Different approach | Deferred partially
- **Impact:** Low (cosmetic) | Medium (functional difference) | High (core behavior change)

**Missing / Not Started** — For each missing feature:
- PRD section reference and what it specified.
- Evidence status: No code at all | Stub/placeholder exists | TODO comment found
- If there is a TODO or comment referencing this feature, cite the file and line.

**Scope Additions** — Features in the code that have no PRD counterpart:
- What it is and which files implement it.
- Inferred reason (infrastructure need, developer tooling, discovered requirement, etc.).

**Architectural Divergences** — Technical decisions that differ from the PRD:
- What the PRD specified vs. what was chosen.
- Whether the divergence is an improvement, trade-off, or potential concern.
- Example: "PRD specified PostgreSQL (§5) but Firestore was used instead. This trades relational querying for simpler setup and document-based storage."

**Alignment Score** — Structured assessment:
- **Score:** High (>80% implemented as specified) | Medium (50-80%) | Low (<50%)
- **Implementation Coverage:** X of Y PRD features have corresponding code.
- **Fidelity:** Of implemented features, how closely do they match the spec?
- **Recommendation:** Whether the PRD should be updated to reflect reality.

### Rules for Drift Analysis
- ALWAYS reference specific PRD section numbers (e.g., "PRD §8.3").
- ALWAYS reference specific code files (e.g., `lib/auth/github.ts`).
- Do NOT editorialize. "The PRD specified X but Y was built" is correct. "The developer chose a better approach" is not — state the facts and let the reader judge.
- If you cannot determine whether something was implemented, mark it "[NEEDS VERIFICATION]" and explain what you could not resolve.
