## Output Format: AS_BUILT_HUMAN.md

Produce a human-readable markdown document written in clear, plain language. Your audience includes:
- Non-technical stakeholders who want to understand what was built.
- New developers joining the project who need orientation.
- The original developer returning after weeks away.

This is NOT a dumbed-down version of the agent doc. It is a different document with different goals: comprehension over completeness, narrative over data.

### Mandatory Document Structure

### Section Requirements

**What Is This?** — An executive summary. 2-3 paragraphs covering: what the project does, the problem it solves, and its primary value proposition. Write as if explaining to someone who has never seen the project. No jargon.

**Who Is It For?** — Describe the target users in plain language. What roles, what situations, what problems they face. Use bullet points for distinct user types.

**How It Works** — Walk through the main user flow step-by-step, from start to finish. Use numbered steps. Describe what happens from the user's perspective, then briefly explain what happens behind the scenes. Example:
1. The user uploads their project files.
2. The system filters out non-essential files (dependencies, build output, images).
3. The remaining code is sent to an AI model for analysis.
4. The AI produces structured documentation.
5. Results are available for download.

**What's Under the Hood** — A non-intimidating overview of the technology. Use a table:
| What | Technology | Why |
Explain technology choices in terms of benefits ("Fast page loads" not "SSR with ISR").

**Key Features** — A list of what the app actually does. For each feature:
- **Feature Name** — 1-2 sentences describing what it does and why it matters.
Mark features as Complete, In Progress, or Planned.

**Data & Storage** — What data is saved, where, and for how long. Written for someone who might ask "what happens to my data?" Plain language, no schema notation.

**Security & Privacy** — How user data is protected, authentication approach, what is encrypted, what is never stored. Focus on what a user or stakeholder would care about.

**Setup & Configuration** — How to get the project running locally, explained for a developer who just cloned the repo. Step-by-step with prerequisites listed first.

**Current State** — An honest assessment:
- What works end-to-end right now.
- What is partially built or needs more work.
- Known issues or limitations.
- What comes next (if there are TODO markers or roadmap indicators in the code).

**Glossary** — Define project-specific terms that appear throughout the document.

### Tone & Style Rules for Human Output
- Write in present tense, active voice. "The app sends an email" not "An email will be sent by the app."
- Explain WHY, not just WHAT. "Files are deleted immediately after processing to protect user privacy" is better than "Files are deleted after processing."
- Avoid code blocks unless they genuinely help explain a concept. Prefer plain language descriptions.
- Use analogies when they help: "Think of it like a spell-checker, but for your project documentation."
- Keep paragraphs short (3-4 sentences max).
- Use bold for emphasis, not ALL CAPS or exclamation marks.
- If you must reference a technical concept, explain it inline: "...uses a background function (a process that runs behind the scenes without making the user wait)..."
